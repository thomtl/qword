Get a prebuilt qword distro at: https://ci.oogacraft.com/job/qword/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/qword.hdd.xz

Note: the default username/password is root/root.

As the name implies, this is just the kernel. To build the whole system, follow the
instructions at <https://github.com/qword-os/build>.

## Build requirements

These are the tools needed for the build:
- `git` (only for the initial download).
- `bash`.
- `make`.
- `gcc`, 8 or higher.
- `nasm`.
- `objcopy`.
- `qemu` (to test it).

## Building

```bash
# Clone repo wherever you like and enter.
git clone https://github.com/qword-os/qword.git
cd qword
# Make the kernel, you can replace the 4 in -j4 with your number of cores + 1.
make clean && make -j4
# Install in PREFIX, may need root permissions depending on the place.
sudo make install PREFIX=..
# Uninstall if needed in the specified PREFIX.
sudo make uninstall PREFIX=..
```
